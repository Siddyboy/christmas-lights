USB Christmas Lights' Controller

- Existing USB lights are 5 V at 1 A

- Box
- Mains Power inlet/fuse
- Traco 5 VDC (for lights) and 12 VDC (for Arduino) PSU.
- Arduino UNO - wifi? for time - see clock below
- Arduino 4 x relay shield - seems good enough for lights.
- Startech (CPC) 4x USB 2.0 Female to 2x 10 Pin IDC Motherboard Header Female Slot Plate Adaptor -  USBPLATE4

Basically to power lights on and off at set times.

But could add subtle clock functionality.
1. Turn off at the hour and then blink on the hour.
1. Blink off 1, 2 or 3 times at 15, 30 or 45 past the hour.
1. Go crazy at 4pm for tea - blink out the tea for two tune rhythm?
1. Others?

Probably not sophis enough for PWM through the relays! :(

Include indicator LEDs in box so lights don't have to be connected for testing?

Power LED lihgt from traco visible?

Other permanently on UBS charger socket?
